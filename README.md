# baby-lattice-folding
This is an educational project aiming to build a Rust implementation of lattice-based folding schemes, progressing through theoretical research, practical code analysis, and hands-on development to understand lattice folding.

Our plan: 1. theoretical research 2. practical learning 3. coding

## 1. theoretical research

Goal: Read recent lattice-based folding schemes: Hypernova, Latticefold, Latticefold plus, Neo and SALSAA. Understand how lattice-based folding schemes are designed and the current bottlenecks.

Paper list:
1. [Hypernova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/573)
2. [Latticefold](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/257)
3. [Latticefold+](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/247)
4. [Neo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/294)
5. [SALSAA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2124)

Product: videos or lectures or blogs

Time: 2 months

## 2. practical learning

Goal: Study existing code and understand benchmarks for lattice-based folding schemes.

Codes:

 2. <https://github.com/lattice-arguments/salsaa>

Product: educational notes

Time: 2 months 

## 3. coding

Goal: We plan to develop baby lattice folding, an educational Rust implementation of the lattice-based folding scheme (SALSAA), building upon existing theoretical and practical foundations.

Product: codes

Time: 3 months
